<h4>
    <p>
      Thank you for your interest in becoming a founding member! As a founding member you will receive a <b>50%</b> discount on your first year of membership. To thank our Founding Members, we are offering Founding Memberships at half the price our normal memberships will cost. Similar to other crowdfunding efforts, we want to give you comfort knowing that there are others willing to contribute. Our goal is to raise a minimum of $4500 in Founding Memberships and donations as proof of the demand for Gearhead Workspace. If we do not reach at least this level of support by the end of January 2015, we will refund any contributions that have been made.
    </p>

    <p>
      The money you contribute to Gearhead Workspace during the Founding Membership phase is considered a donation that is not tax-deductible. We will be using this money to pay lawyers, accountants, and other service providers in the expectation that we will be opening our first garage in the second half of 2015. If for some reason we are not able to open, we cannot guarantee that your donation will be returned to you. Memberships will become valid the day we have our grand opening and the membership period will be for one year after that day. After the first year, you will be invited to continue your membership by choosing from one of the options available at that time.
